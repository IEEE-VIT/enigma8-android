## About

The IEEE-VIT Student Chapter hosts Enigma 8.0, an online cryptic quest. Thousands of participants from all around the world compete in this effort, which was entirely conceived and driven by students. 
We are unbeaten in the 8th edition of Enigma since no one has ever been able to accomplish our challenge!

A cryptic hunt with a gripping tale that you must traverse deftly also includes two types of currency in the game: Keys¬†and powerups that may be used throughout the game's levels. 
On the leaderboard, the contestant with the most points wins the desired championship.

We want to provide a platform where people from all around the world can compete for points by using problem-solving abilities and unconventional approaches to crack the code. 
Only the best will be allowed to compete for the top spots on the scoreboard!
